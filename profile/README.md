**Temporal** delivers an open-source durable execution solution that abstracts away the complexity of building scalable, reliable distributed systems. It presents a development abstraction that preserves complete application state so that in the case of a host or software failure it can seamlessly migrate execution to another machine. 

## Developing with Temporal
Temporal allows you to code for resilience in your applications and eliminates complex failure, error handling, and failure handling logic from applications, so you can focus on what matters â€“ delivering reliable systems, faster. 

More explicitly, Temporal accelerates development by eliminating the need to write custom code for timers, event sourcing, state checkpointing, retries, and timeouts. It also simplifies your infrastructure by eliminating the need for queues, pub/sub systems, and schedulers. 

## Temporal Adopters
Thousands of companies use Temporal today for both mission-critical and basic workloads. Some of these innovative organizations include Stripe, Netflix, Datadog, HashiCorp, Alaska Airlines, Box, and many more. Typical use cases for Temporal include service orchestration, transaction processing, infrastructure management, async tasks, and job scheduling. 

Every message on Twilio, every Coinbase transaction, and every Snap story uses Temporal.
