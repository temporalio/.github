Temporal is an open-source library for writing reliable code. It substantially simplifies development, obviating the need to use queues and timers, publish and consume events, checkpoint state, retry, and more. It's used by Stripe, Netflix, Datadog, Coinbase, and many more for a wide range of use cases including service orchestration, infra management, transaction processing, async tasks, and crons.
